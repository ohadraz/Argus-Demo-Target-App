"""What the account page keeps about the shoppers who have been by.

The store itself is small and does what it says. What these pin down is the
part that matters to an incident: it grows with every new shopper up to a cap
and no further, which is what keeps a long-running process from climbing for as
long as new shoppers keep arriving - and that a new process starts empty, which
is why restarting the shop is worth anything.
